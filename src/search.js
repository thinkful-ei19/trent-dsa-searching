// The Dewey Decimal system
// Since the books are already in order of decimal number, first step would be to cut the dataset in half and
// check if the number you are looking for is greater or less than the middle. Based on that you can reduce
// the dataset by half and then you can loop through the remaining side until you find the correct decimal, and then
// you check it to the title for each of those until you return the book
